    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul class="ingredients-section">
            <li>1 lb fettuccine pasta</li>
            <li>6 tablespoons butter</li>
            <li>1 clove garlic</li>
            <li>1.5 cups heavy cream</li>
            <li>1/4 teaspoon salt</li>
            <li>1 1/4 cup shredded parmesan cheese</li>
            <li>1/4 teaspoon pepper</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol class="steps-section">
            <li>In a large pot, heat water over high heat until boiling. Add salt to season the water. Once it is boiling, add fettuccine and cook according to package instructions. </li>
            <li>In a large skillet or pan, heat butter over medium heat. Add minced garlic and cook for 1 to 2 minutes. Stir in heavy cream.</li>
            <li>Let heavy cream reduce and cook for 5 to 8 minutes. Add half of the parmesan cheese to the mixture and whisk well until smooth. Keep over heat and whisk well until cheese is melted.</li>
            <li>Save some pasta water. The pasta water is full of flavor and can be used to thin out the sauce.</li>
            <li>Toss alfredo sauce with fettuccine pasta and add half of the parmesan cheese. Once it is tossed, garnish with the remaining parmesan cheese. Add a little pasta water if it needs to be thinned out.</li>
