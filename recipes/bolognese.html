    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>This is a recipe for spaghetti bolognese.Rich, thick, incredible flavour in the sauce even if you only have time for a quick 20 minute simmer. Though if you can slow cook for a couple of hours, it really takes it to another level!  </p>

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>

    <ul>
        class="ingredients-section">
        <li>2 tbsp olive oil</li>
        <li>2 garlic cloves</li>
        <li>1 onion</li>
        <li>1 lb ground beef</li>
        <li>1/2 cup dry red wine</li>
        <li>2 beef bouillon cubes</li>
        <li>28 oz can crushed tomato</li>
        <li>2 tbsp tomato paste</li>
        <li>2 dried bay leaves</li>
        <li>salt and pepper</li>
        </div>
    </ul>

    <h4>Steps</h4>
    
        <ol> 
            <li>Heat oil in a large pot or deep skillet over medium high heat. Add onion and garlic, cook for 3 minutes or until light golden and softened.</li>
            <li>Turn heat up to high and add beef. Cook, breaking it up as your go, until browned.</li>
            <li>Add red wine. Bring to simmer and cook for 1 minute, scraping the bottom of the pot, until the alcohol smell is gone.</li>
            <li>Add remaining ingredients except salt and pepper. Stir, bring to a simmer then turn down to medium so it bubbles gently. Cook for 20 – 30 minutes (no lid), adding water if the sauce gets too thick for your taste. Stir occasionally.</li>
            <li>Adjust salt and pepper to taste right at the end. Serve over spaghetti – though if you have the time, I recommend tossing the sauce and pasta per steps below.</li>
        </ol>
