# This challenge was rewarding because we didn't work on this in pod time last Tuesday. So I was (hopefully) able to complete it all by myslef. After I made the first recipe, I was disappoonted to see that I had to make 2 or 3 more. But by the end, I was happy because I got faster at it, and it was good practice.
